            It is with deep regret that we announce the closing of Cornerstone Christian Academy with the 2020-2021
            school year. The Cornerstone Church Finance Committee and the Board of Elders, after much prayer and many
            conversations, have come to this very difficult decision due to the COVID-19 pandemic and diminishing
            enrollment over the past few years.

            CCA has a long history of faithfully serving the congregation and community. Many families chose CCA
            because of the loving and caring atmosphere, strong academic instruction and commitment to “train up a child
            in the way he should go,” making a triangle of influence with the church, the school and each family. We are
            grateful to be a rich part of that legacy for children who, we hope, will grow up to someday change the
            world for Jesus.
