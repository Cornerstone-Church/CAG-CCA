                                    students are encouraged to know Christ personally and to yield to His will in every
                                    area of their life.

                                    develop individual aptitudes and to cultivate the power of critical thinking.

                                    to live in the world and yet not be of the world while teaching them loyalty to God,
                                    their home, and our country.

                                    life’s situations in a God-honoring way that develops self-discipline.

                                    students are taught to develop a respect for the body as the temple of the Holy
                                    Spirit, intelligent care of the body, and are encouraged in the yielding of the body
                                    as an instrument for God’s use.

            <h1>Beyond Our Walls</h1>
            <p>The home, church, and
                school form a triangle of institutional influence in a child’s life. Therefore, it is imperative that
                all three of these influences are in agreement. The school can never compensate for the home, but it can
                supplement the sound Biblical principles being outlined
                by parents to their children.</p>
