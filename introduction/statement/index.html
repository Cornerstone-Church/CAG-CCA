        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>
            Cornerstone Christian Academy (CCA) is registered with the Maryland State Department of Education as a
            non-profit
            church-exempt school. CCA is a member of the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI).
            <br><br>
            As a ministry of Cornerstone Church, our mission is four-fold. We are building an authentic community,
            lifting
            up Jesus, growing in Him and touching our world. We believe that the family, church and school form a
            triangle of influence in a child’s life. The school
            can never compensate for the home. Therefore, we form a partnership with our parents to build a strong
            foundation of faith.
            <br><br>
            We desire to equip our students to grow in their love for God and desire to obey His Word. We want to teach
            them to respect God, respect their leaders, and respect each other. Our approach will be one of Redemptive
            Discipline. Our goal is for students to not
            only learn to obey out of love for Christ but most importantly be conformed into the image of Christ (Romans
            8:29). We desire that student learn to take ownership for their choices and ultimately learn what God’s
            expectations are for them.
            <br><br>
            We will focus on character traits taught throughout all grades and help deepen the students understanding
            and
            meaning behind each character trait. Developing good inward character traits will ultimately show in a
            student’s outward actions.
            <br><br>
            In order to cultivate a positive social and educational atmosphere, students will learn to recognize that
            acceptable standards of behavior are important. Redemptive discipline reminds us that our ability to do what
            is right depends on a daily renewing of the heart
            as well as allowing the Holy Spirit and Word to grow within us. Discipline will be administered when any
            individual’s actions interfere with the right of the teachers to teach and the students to learn.
            <br><br>
            In order to see young lives molded, we strive to understand individuals and recognize each may be at a
            different level of maturity. We also seek to distinguish between those who have made first-time mistakes and
            those who are repeat offenders or mockers, although
            in some circumstances, first-time offenses may be of sufficient severity to warrant suspension or expulsion.
            <br><br>
            Where appropriate, we want to encourage students to grow and change as a result of their mistakes and
            failures.
            This is not to say there will not be consequences for these actions, but rather, we want to allow students
            to appropriately experience consequences and
            the growth that can result from them.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Beliefs & Guiding Philospohy</h2>
        <div>
            <br>Cornerstone
            holds to an orthodox historical Christian faith, as reflected in these basic statements of our beliefs.
            About
            the Bible: We believe that the Bible is fully inspired by God, that it is entirely trustworthy and is our
            guide for faith and life. (2 Timothy 3:16)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>About God:</b>
            <br>We believe that God is the loving Creator of all that exists, both seen and unseen. God is eternal and
            completely good, knowing all things, having all power and majesty. God exists eternally as the Trinity, in
            three persons, yet one God: Father, Son, and
            Holy Spirit. (Isaiah 40:28, Genesis 1:1-31)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>About Jesus:</b>
            <br>We believe that God expressed Himself in human form through Jesus Christ. Jesus was born of the Virgin
            Mary and lived a sinless life. We believe He was crucified for the sins of us all, rose again from the dead
            and ascended to heaven. (John 11:25-26)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>About the Holy Spirit:</b>
            <br>We believe that the Holy Spirit is sent from God to live in all who believe in Jesus. He teaches,
            comforts, and empowers us, giving each follower of Jesus diverse gifts for serving in the church and serving
            others in the world. We believe it
            is through the Holy Spirit that we change and develop a holy life and Jesus-like character. (Acts 1:8)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>About Salvation:</b>
            <br>We believe that all people are created with dignity and great value in the image of God and that people
            were created to live in a thriving relationship with God. However, through our sin (failing to live by God’s
            moral standards), we break our intended
            relationship with God and we experience the sad consequences of that broken relationship, both spiritually
            and socially. However, because of God’s love for us, He sent His Son, Jesus, to rescue us from those
            consequences and to restore our broken relationship
            with God. Jesus´ death on the cross was a perfect act of redemption for each of us. We receive the free gift
            of forgiveness and are spiritually reborn through repenting (changing our mind and heart) of our sin and
            placing faith in Jesus alone. (John 3:16)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>About the Church:</b>
            <br>We believe that the church is comprised of any person, anywhere in the world who puts their faith in
            Jesus. The church itself is people who are empowered by God’s Spirit to be part of the mission of Jesus here
            on earth. The church is one global
            community, but has smaller, local expressions, such as Cornerstone. Each local church expression has a
            unique personality and we see beauty in that diversity. We believe that the church does not exist for
            itself, but exists as a community of worshipers who
            are here to serve others, as we bring the love and hope of Jesus to the world around us. (Ephesians 2:19-20)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>About the Afterlife and End Times:</b>
            <br>We believe there is a literal heaven and hell and one day Jesus will return. We approach the topics of
            the afterlife and end times with great mystery and wonder. (Colossians 3:1-4)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>Divine Healing:</b>
            <br>Wherever Jesus went, He ministered with compassion and healed the sick. Christ’s example showed an
            interconnection with salvation because many believed following their healing. Our Lord continues to heal
            today and it is vital that the church preach,
            teach and practice this biblical truth. Scriptures command believers to pray in faith and trust God for the
            outcome. (Matthew 4:23, 1 Peter 2:24)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>Empowerment of the Holy Spirit:</b>
            <br>The doctrine of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is our distinctive. This truth explains the passion and
            power of our witness. Jesus promised His followers they would receive power from on high so that they would
            be His witnesses. We believe
            this truth is just as relevant today as our Fellowship continues to take the gospel message around the
            globe. (Acts 2:38)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>The Second Coming:</b>
            <br>With the world experiencing natural disasters, economic downturns, and increasing uncertainties on many
            fronts, the doctrine of Christ’s Second Coming is more relevant than ever. Believers must rest in the
            certainty of the imminent return of
            our Lord, live their lives in view of this, and share this hope with others. (2 Peter 3:11-13)
        </div>
        <div>
            <br><b>Marriage and Family:</b>
            <br>We believe God defines marriage as the permanent, exclusive, comprehensive, and conjugal “one flesh”
            union of one man and one woman, intrinsically ordered to procreation and biological family. (Genesis
            1:27–28; 2:18–24; Mark 10:5–9). We believe
            that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of a marriage between a man
            and a woman. We believe that any form of homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, transgenderism, adultery,
            and pornography are sinful perversions of God's
            gift. (Genesis 2:24; Lev. 18:1-30; Romans 1:26-29; I Corinthians 5:1, 6:9; I Thessalonians 4:1-8; Hebrews
            13:4)
