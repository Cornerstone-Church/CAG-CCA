                Greetings CCA Families,
                <br><br>I am greatly honored and humbled to serve as your principal. Cornerstone Christian Academy is a truly special school that has provided a wonderful spiritual and academic foundation for each of my own children. Now, I am excited to partner with each of you and your children as they begin to walk through and discover God's magnificent plan for their lives.
                <br><br>While CCA already provides outlets for effective communication, I hope to use this forum as an additional means of updating you on quarterly activities. But, the start of these summer months have given me time to both reflect upon God's faithfulness and prepare for the work He is about to do. 
                <br><br>I reflect upon the amazing work that was done through VBS. Over 500 children joined us this summer for Vacation Bible School as the CCA classrooms were "powered up" and transformed into fun video game themes to help remind everyone that His true power lives within us. The move of the Holy Spirit was awesome and I was so glad to see, meet, and work beside the many CCA students, parents, and staff members who attended.
                <br><br>Preparations allow me to see an exciting future on the horizon for CCA. While renovation projects, professional development courses, website updates, curriculum planning, and classroom re-paintings occur throughout the building over these next two months, I know that even much greater changes are in store for us as we diligently seek His face. May His will always be above any plans for CCA.
                <br><br>As we continue through the summer months, I pray for each family's safety and continued growth in Him. I pray that we will all strive in one accord to reflect Christ in our words and deeds. And, as this is the summer, I pray that we all take some time to break routines and enjoy a new wonder of His immense creation with families. I look forward to meeting you in August and hearing all about our students' summer activities!
                <br><br>To keep the lines of communication open, feel free to contact me by e-mail at dalston@cag.org with any questions, comments, or concerns. CCA summer hours are 9am -3pm Monday -Thursday and 9am-12 noon on Friday. Please call or e-mail ahead for an appointment.
                <br><br>Thankful for all those helping us prepare for the new school year with painting and remodeling at CCA:
