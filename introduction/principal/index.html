                    <br>As we prepare for the new school year, our summer staff reminds everyone of the Godâ€™s words puts
                    the finishing touches on CCA bulletin boards!
                    <br><br>Greetings CCA families,
                    <br>God is so good! Let's all give thanks for His faithfulness. Just take a moment to reflect on His
                    faithfulness in your life today and share that testimony with your children. I pray that we can take
                    the time to "Reflect" His face to His children each day.
                    <br>
                    <br>With the start of the school year soon approaching, our God has been faithful in so many ways:
                    From
                    growing our staff, to updating our facilities; from expanding community partnerships to enhancing
                    our technology curriculum, excitement abounds in all He has done and all He has in store.
                    <br>
                    <br>Since you've already heard a little bit about the great work our building service team has been
                    doing around the school, let me share some new details about CCA's enhanced technology curriculum
                    for this year. Not only will students in our primary grades have access to computers, and gain
                    instruction in exercising safe computer use, but they will also have opportunities to demonstrate
                    proper keyboarding techniques and practice producing graphics while building basic scripts and
                    loops. Upper elementary students will have opportunities to design publications using digital media
                    and present researched information effectively to an audience. More information about our technology
                    enhancements will be shared at the Aug 22 student orientation.
                    <br>
                    <br>The first day of school is August 26! Please join the CCA staff in prayer for our school year on
                    Saturday, August 24 at 7pm in the Cornerstone sanctuary.
                    <br>
                    <br>Do enjoy these last days of summer. I look forward to seeing everyone soon!

                <h2>Summer 2019</h2>
                <p>
                    Greetings CCA Families,
                    <br><br>I am greatly honored and humbled to serve as your principal. Cornerstone Christian Academy
                    is a truly special school that has provided a wonderful spiritual and academic foundation for each
                    of my own children. Now, I am excited to partner with each of you and your children as they begin to
                    walk through and discover God's magnificent plan for their lives.
                    <br><br>While CCA already provides outlets for effective communication, I hope to use this forum as
                    an additional means of updating you on quarterly activities. But, the start of these summer months
                    have given me time to both reflect upon God's faithfulness and prepare for the work He is about to
                    do.
                    <br><br>I reflect upon the amazing work that was done through VBS. Over 500 children joined us this
                    summer for Vacation Bible School as the CCA classrooms were "powered up" and transformed into fun
                    video game themes to help remind everyone that His true power lives within us. The move of the Holy
                    Spirit was awesome and I was so glad to see, meet, and work beside the many CCA students, parents,
                    and staff members who attended.
                    <br><br>Preparations allow me to see an exciting future on the horizon for CCA. While renovation
                    projects, professional development courses, website updates, curriculum planning, and classroom
                    re-paintings occur throughout the building over these next two months, I know that even much greater
                    changes are in store for us as we diligently seek His face. May His will always be above any plans
                    for CCA.
                    <br><br>As we continue through the summer months, I pray for each family's safety and continued
                    growth in Him. I pray that we will all strive in one accord to reflect Christ in our words and
                    deeds. And, as this is the summer, I pray that we all take some time to break routines and enjoy a
                    new wonder of His immense creation with families. I look forward to meeting you in August and
                    hearing all about our students' summer activities!
                    <br><br>To keep the lines of communication open, feel free to contact me by e-mail at
                    dalston@cag.org with any questions, comments, or concerns. CCA summer hours are 9am -3pm Monday
                    -Thursday and 9am-12 noon on Friday. Please call or e-mail ahead for an appointment.
                    <br><br>Thankful for all those helping us prepare for the new school year with painting and
                    remodeling at CCA:
