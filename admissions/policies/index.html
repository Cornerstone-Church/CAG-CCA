        <h1>Student Conduct</h1>
        <p>
            Cornerstone Christian Academy seeks to provide quality education in a nurturing, Christian environment. CCA
            has standards of conduct and social behavior that are based on Biblical guidelines rather than those of the
            culture, the popular media, or peer groups. An integral part of the education process is the challenge for
            students to accept responsibility for their commitment to personal integrity.

        <h2>Biblical Guidelines for Student Conduct</h2>
        <u>Reflect Jesus:</u> “Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is
        pure, whatever is admirable – if anything is excellent or praiseworthy – think about such things.” (Philippians
        4:8)
        <br><br><u>Respect Authority:</u> “Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority
        except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he
        who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring
        judgment on themselves.” (Romans 13:1-2)
        <br><br><u>Respect and Esteem One Another:</u> Consider one another as better than ourselves. Protecting the dignity of
        all students is our aim. Malicious talk can do more harm than physical wounds. (Philippians 2:3, 1 Corinthians
        6:19-20, Matthew 15:11, Proverbs 18:24)
        <br><br><u>Be an Example:</u> “Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the
        believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith, and in purity.” (1 Timothy 4:12)
        <br><br><u>Seek Excellence:</u> “I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.” (Philippians 4:13)
        <br><br><u>Be Honest:</u> “Providing for honest things not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of man.”
        (2 Corinthians 8:21)
        <br><br><u>Be Truthful:</u> “Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we
        are all members of one body.” (Ephesians 4:25)
        <br><br><u>Wholesome Speech:</u> “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouth, but only what is helpful for
        building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.” (Ephesians 4:32)
